CONFLIX - The Stylized Movie List

## Description

Conflix is a simple Movie List app that displays movies as buttons. The user can click the movie buttons to see a brief description of the movie and its genres. Movie Data is stored in a database and is persistent. The ability for users to add movies to the movie list via form is in development and will be added soon.
